Glyph

Glyph is a framework designed to manage multiple RESTish web services. While the framework
uses Mojolicious and intends the running services to be robust and relatively lightweight, the framework
itself is full-featured and and targetted to 'Enterprise' grade needs, where having the ability to
run multiple services that can scale horizontally but still share code is a big win.

Project will include scripts to initiate a repo and add services in your own namespace using the framework.
